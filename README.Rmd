Use `ckbplotr` to create and style publication-quality plots. The package is focused on plots for epidemiology and is developed by a [China Kadoorie Biobank](http://www.ckbiobank.org) and [Oxford Population Health](https://www.ndph.ox.ac.uk/) researcher.



## Installation

Install the latest version of `ckbplotr` from the neilstats R-universe:
```{r install from runiverse, eval = FALSE}
install.packages('ckbplotr',
                 repos = c('https://neilstats.r-universe.dev',
                           getOption('repos')))
```



## Get started

Read `vignette("ckbplotr")` to get started.

Additional examples and tutorials for using the package can be found at <https://neilstats.github.io/ckbplotr-book>.



## Key features

The package can be used to apply CKB style and to create plots by generating ggplot2 code. Functions that create plots (such as `shape_plot()` and `forest_plot()`) return both:

- **A ggplot2 plot**.
- **The ggplot2 code used to create the plot**, allowing users to see exactly how the plot has been created and adapt the code for other uses. In RStudio the code will also be shown in the Viewer pane.
