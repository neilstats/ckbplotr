`ckbplotr` helps create and style plots in R. It is 
developed by, and primarily for, [China Kadoorie Biobank](http://www.ckbiobank.org) 
researchers.

## Key features

The package can be used to apply CKB style and to create plots by generating ggplot2 code. Functions that create plots (such as `shape_plot()` and `forest_plot()`) return both:

- **A ggplot2 plot**.
- **The ggplot2 code used to create the plot**, allowing users to see exactly how the plot has been created and adapt the code for other uses. In RStudio the code will also be shown in the Viewer pane.



## Installation

Install the latest version of `ckbplotr` from the neilstats R-universe:
```{r install from runiverse, eval = FALSE}
install.packages('ckbplotr',
                 repos = c('https://neilstats.r-universe.dev',
                           'https://cloud.r-project.org'))
```
This will also install dependencies from the CRAN repository.
